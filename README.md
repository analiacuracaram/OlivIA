# OlivIA
Classifying healthy vs diseased olive leaves with MobileNetV2, a step toward accessible ML in agriculture

## Summary
This final project proposes the development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained with local olive leaf images, aiming to provide an accessible, accurate, and offline-ready solution designed to support farmers in rural and low-resource contexts.

## Observed Problem
Early detection of olive tree diseases is crucial to prevent economic losses, especially in small farms. However, existing tools are not specialized for this crop, often require a stable internet connection, and fail to consider local conditions.

## Research Hypothesis
“It is possible to detect diseases and pests in olive trees, specifically through leaf analysis, using images captured with common devices such as mobile phones owned by local farmers.”
